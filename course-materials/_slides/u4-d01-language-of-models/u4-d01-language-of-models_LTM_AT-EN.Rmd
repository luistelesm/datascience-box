# What is a **model**?

---

## Linear models

- We use **models** to analyze the relationship between several (random) variables. Goal:
   - make predictions (through statistical inference)...
   - about unknown aspects of reality (parameters)...
   - from known information (samples).
--

- Here we will stick to linear models, or **linear regression**
- Bear in mind that reality is often not linear...
   - Linearity: simplifying hypothesis

Two paintings very rich in composition, of a beautiful execution, and whose merit is very remarkable, each 17 inches 3 lines high, 23 inches wide; the first, painted on wood, comes from the Cabinet of Madame la Comtesse de Verrue; it represents a **departure for the hunt**: it shows in the front a child on a white horse, a man who gives the horn to gather the dogs, a falconer and other figures nicely distributed across the width of the painting; two horses drinking from a fountain; on the right in the corner a lovely country house topped by a terrace, on which people are at the table, others who play instruments; trees and fabriques pleasantly enrich the background.

## Insert slide on read_excel

---

## Import the data

- Import the data in the **data** sheet of the Excel book **paris-paintings.xlsx**:
   - For an object with the name **pp**
   - Ensuring that any of these: "n/a", "", "NA" is correctly interpreted as `r NA` value

- Try using R menus first...
- ... and then using the **read_excel** function. What is the fastest way?

---

## Import the data

```{r dnload-data, message=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
pp <- readxl::read_excel("data/paris-paintings.xlsx", sheet = "data",
                na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))

## Vocabulary

- **Dependent variable** or **response** Variable whose behavior we want to understand / variability we want to explain from another(s) -- **yy** axis

--
- **Independent variables** or **explanatory** Other variables that we use to explain the behavior of the dependent variable -- axis **xx**

--
- **Estimated** or predicted or adjusted value ($\hat{y}$): the output of the **model**
   - The model gives the average (or expected) value of the dependent variable, *conditional*, i.e. for a given value, of the independent variable
  
--
- **Residual**: A measure of how far each case is from its predicted value (based on a particular model)
   - Residual = Observed value - Predicted value
   - Indicates how close the model is to "getting it right" at a given point in the data, or in other words, how much the model "fails"

.question[
- What changed in the graph?
- What pattern in the data has now become apparent?
- What could it mean, in statistical terms? And in reality?
]

```{r height-width-plot-alpha, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="55%"}
ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
   labs(
     title = "Height vs. width of paintings",

     x = "Width (inches)",
     y = "Height (inches)"
   )
```

## Landscapes vs. portraits

- Landscape painting is the representation of landscapes - natural settings such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers and forests
composition
    - Usually width $> $ height
- In portrait painting the intention is to portray a human subject:
    - Usually width $<$ height

## Models, opportunities and risks

- **Opportunity**: statistical models can reveal patterns that cannot be revealed in a graph
   - especially in multiple regression models, i.e. with several explanatory variables simultaneously (next class)


.pull-left[
```{r width-plot-alpha, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
ggplot(data = pp %>% select(Width_in,Height_in, landsALL) %>% pivot_longer(c('Width_in','Height_in')) %>% filter(landsALL == 0)
        ) +
   geom_histogram(aes(x = value, fill = name),alpha = 0.6, position = 'identity') +
   labs(
     title = "Portraits",
     x = "Inches",
     y = "n"
   ) + theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r hheight-plot-alpha, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
ggplot(data = pp %>% select(Width_in,Height_in, landsALL) %>% pivot_longer(c('Width_in','Height_in')) %>% filter(landsALL == 1)
        ) +
   geom_histogram(aes(x = value, fill = name), alpha = 0.6, position = 'identity') +
   labs(
     title = "Landscapes",
     x = "Inches",
     y = "n"
   ) + theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```
]

## Models, opportunities and risks

- **Risk**: a model may indicate that the data has a certain structure (a distribution) that does not correspond to reality -- spurious regression

.pull-left[
```{r ursa-plot-no-se, warning=FALSE, echo = F, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Width_in, y = logprice)) + xlim(0,150) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm",
               se = FALSE) + #<<
   labs(
     title = "Height vs. width of frames",
     subtitle = "Paris auctions, 1764 - 1780",
     x = "Width, inches",
     y = "Height, inches"
   )
